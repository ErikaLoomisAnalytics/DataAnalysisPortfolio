# Portfolio
# "Data Exploration and Cleaning" and "Data Visualization" notebooks are the final product of my IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone Project. 

# "Covid Analytics" is an independent project I developed using MS SQL Server and publicly available covid data.

# These files are not comprehensive of skills learned in the course, but they are a polished and demonstrative final product. Thank you for taking the time to review them.
